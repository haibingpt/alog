## Deploying server-side code to Cloudflare

### Steps: 

#### 1. Create a new Cloudflare worker

* Once logged in, navigate to the "**Workers & Pages**" section.
* Click on "**Create Application**" → "**Create Worker**".
* Rename the Worker as per your requirements.
* Click on "**Deploy**".

#### 2. Configure your worker

* After deploying, you'll see a "**Quick Edit**" button. Click on it.
* Paste the contents of [Server/src/worker.js](Server/src/worker.js) into the Cloudflare Worker editor.
* Click on "**Save and deploy**"

#### 3. Set Environment variables:

* On the Worker's **Settings** tab, navigate to the **Variables** section.
* Set the following variables:

| Variable         |            | Description          |
|------------------|------------|----------------------|
| **`OPENAI_KEY`** | *Required* | Your OpenAI API key. |
| **`HMAC_KEY`**   | *Optional* | This should be consistent with the key used on the client side. If this variable is not set, HMAC validation will not be performed. |
| **`AI_MODEL`**   | *Optional* | Represents the default model. If not set, the model specified by the client will be used.                                           |

#### 4. Update API base URL

* Open `Constants.swift` file.
* Update the `api_base_url` constant to point to the URL of your deployed Cloudflare Worker.

```swift
struct Constants {
    static let api_base_url = URL(string: "https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/")!
}
```
